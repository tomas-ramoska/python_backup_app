# Backup App by Tomas

A no-nonsense Python backup application built with Tkinter. This tool lets you select multiple source folders and back them up to a chosen destination folder. It keeps track of progress, logs errors, and even lets you cancel the operation if things go awry.

## Features

- **Multiple Source Folders:** Add one or more folders to back up.
- **Destination Selection:** Choose where you want your backup stored.
- **Progress Tracking:** Visual progress bar with percentage.
- **Cancel Operation:** Stop the backup process mid-run.
- **Logging:** Records errors and important events in both a log file and on-screen log panel.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x:** Make sure you’re running a modern version.
- **Tkinter:** Usually included with Python installations.
- **Standard Libraries:** `os`, `shutil`, `threading`, `logging`, `queue`
